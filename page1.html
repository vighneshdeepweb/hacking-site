<p> How To Hack WPA2-PSK Secured Wi-Fi Password Using Kali Linux- </p>

<p> Warning..!! WiFi hacking is illegal.</p> <hr></hr>
<p style = "colour:red;"> 1) STEPS <br>
Step 1: Open Terminal in Kali Linux. The first thing that you need to do is to find out the name of your of your wireless adapter, Just type ifconfig on the terminal and hit enter. Here in my case, wlan0 is my Wireless adapter.


 </br>
<br>Step 2: Now type airmon-ng check kill and hit enter and then type airmon-ng check and then hit enter</br>
<br>Step 3: Enable Monitor mode. Now, we are going to use a tool called airmon-ng to create a virtual interface called mon. Just type airmon-ng start wlan0 and hit enter.</br>
<br>Step 4:Now we have to start capturing packets and to do this we will use airodump-ng. Type airodump-ng wlan0mon and hit enter and after that, You’ll able to see the name of the wifi networks </br>
<br>Step 5: Suppose I want to hack the Wifi Bond_007 all I have to do is just copy the BSSID of the network. Just Select the BSSID and then Press Ctrl+C </br>
<br>Step 6: Now write the command reaver –i wlan0mon -b (BSSID that you had copied) -vv -K 1 and then Hit enter. Voila, You got the passcode.</br>
